# Interpreting-MDETR-Using-Attribution-Guided-Factorization

This repository contains our implementation of Attribution Guided Factorization, a model interpretability method, applied upon a state-of-the-art query-modulated object detection model MDETR.

The code should be able to run out of the box in Google's Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RU-CS535-ADOX/Interpreting-MDETR-Using-Attribution-Guided-Factorization/blob/main/demo.ipynb).

## Building Blocks

The implementation contains the following two building blocks:

### MDETR: Modulated Detection for End-to-End Multi-Modal Understanding
